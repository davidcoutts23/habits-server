# Habit server

I will form good habits and become their slave.
_Og Mandino_

This is a rails app (API only) backed by a postgresql server that exists for the purpose of persisting user data and make that data available to the [habits client](https://github.com/davidcoutts23/habits-client). Most endpoints are authenticated using JWT.
